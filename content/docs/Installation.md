# Installation

OmniOS supports AMD64, with work being done to support ARM64.

## Download OmniOS

You can start by [downloading OmniOS](https://omnios.org/download.html). The image types are:

- ISO images (ending with `.iso`) can be used to boot into using CD.
- USB images (ending with `.usb-dd`) can be used to flash a USB drive to boot a bare-metal server.
- Cloud Images (ending with `.cloud.vmdk`) can be used to run an already-installed OmniOS system on the cloud.
- PXE images (ending with `.zfs.xz`) can be used to boot from the network (more about that later).

## Hardware Requirements

OmniOS is designed to be run on server class systems rather than laptops or generic workstations. You may have luck with this hardware, but there is a good chance you will find your hardware unsupported.

A list of supported hardware is on the [illumos Hardware Compatibility List](http://illumos.org/hcl).
