# History

## OpenSolaris: The Beginning

[OpenSolaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSolaris) was born as an open-source project initiated by Sun Microsystems in 2005. It aimed to open the Solaris operating system to the broader developer community, providing access to its source code and inviting collaboration and contributions. OpenSolaris was built on top of Solaris, a robust and powerful UNIX® operating system known for its scalability, security, and advanced features like ZFS, DTrace, and Zones.

If you're interested in the history of OpenSolaris, Jim Grisanzio has [written an in-depth piece on it](https://jimgrisanzio.wordpress.com/opensolaris/).

After Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010, the company decided to discontinue OpenSolaris, ending its development as an open community project. This decision led to the creation of a series of forks and successor projects by developers and organizations determined to continue the OpenSolaris legacy.

## illumos: A New Beginning

In 2010, [illumos](https://illumos.org) was created as a community-driven fork of the OpenSolaris core operating system, intended to keep the spirit of the project alive while maintaining an open and collaborative development environment. The illumos project focused on providing a fully open-source, cutting-edge operating system platform, removing the closed-source components that Oracle had retained.

For a deeper insight into illumos and its creation, you can read [its announcement](https://illumos.org/docs/about/announcement/) and watch the YouTube talk by Bryan Cantrill, ["Fork Yeah! The Rise and Development of illumos"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_GY03CO3sA) (Note: Potentially not suitable for minors).

illumos continued to develop and enhance many of the core technologies from OpenSolaris, including the ZFS file system, DTrace, and Zones, while also adding new features and improvements. illumos serves as the core for several [downstream operating systems](https://illumos.org/docs/about/distro/), ensuring that the innovations and capabilities of OpenSolaris continue to thrive.

Since 2010, a number of companies have built their businesses around illumos, or are running on one of the distributions built from it. For a very incomplete list, please see [who is using illumos](https://illumos.org/docs/about/who/).

## OmniOS and OmniOS Community Edition (OmniOSce): A Modern Server OS

OmniOS, initially developed by OmniTI in 2012, aimed to provide a modern, stable, and secure server operating system based on the illumos kernel. Designed with a focus on simplicity, ease of use, and enterprise deployment, OmniOS was quickly adopted by organizations looking for a reliable UNIX®-based operating system that continued the legacy of Solaris and OpenSolaris.

The [OmniTI release video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=) at LISA demonstrated the features and capabilities of the initial OmniOS release.

After OmniTI ceased active development in 2017, the community-driven OmniOS Community Edition (OmniOSce) was born. The [announcement video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=) when OmniOS was handed over to the community highlights this transition. OmniOSce has since taken over the reins of development, maintaining and enhancing OmniOS to meet modern needs. The community edition continues to provide regular updates, support, and new features, ensuring that OmniOS remains a powerful, open-source operating system for servers.

**The Present and Future of OmniOSce**

Today, OmniOSce is maintained by an active and dedicated community of developers and users. It continues to build on the illumos foundation, delivering a robust and secure operating system for servers and enterprises. With its strong roots in OpenSolaris, illumos, and the initial OmniOS project, OmniOSce represents the culmination of years of development, innovation, and dedication to the ideals of open-source software.
