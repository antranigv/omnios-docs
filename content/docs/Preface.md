# Preface

This handbook is designed to guide newcomers to OmniOS through the essential steps for getting started with the operating system. The first section covers the installation process and introduces key UNIX® concepts and conventions, aiming to build a solid foundation for users who are new to the platform. All you need to begin is a willingness to learn and an openness to new ideas.

For those who are already familiar with the basics, the second, more extensive section serves as a comprehensive reference for OmniOS system administrators. Each chapter in this section provides detailed information on specific topics, with recommendations for prior reading when necessary, indicated at the beginning of each chapter.

## Typographic Conventions

To make the text easier to read and understand, we use the following typographic conventions throughout this handbook:

- **Multi-line Shell Commands:**
```
Lines that are meant to be typed in a terminal or shell session should be displayed in a monospaced font, often in a code block format.
```

- *Filenames, URLs, Emphasized Text, and First Usage of Technical Terms:*  
  _Italic_ text is used to denote filenames, URLs, emphasized words, and the first use of technical terms.

- **Messages, Commands, Environment Variables, Names of Ports, Hostnames, User Names, Group Names, Device Names, Variables, and Code Fragments:**  
  A monospaced font is used to distinguish messages, commands, environment variables, names of ports, hostnames, user names, group names, device names, variables, and snippets of code from the rest of the text.

- **Applications, Commands, and Keys:**  
  A **bold** font is used for the names of applications, specific commands, and key combinations to make them stand out in the text.

## Acknowledgment

This handbook is based on the [FreeBSD Handbook](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/), an invaluable resource for UNIX® system users and administrators. Many sections have been adapted and modified to fit the specifics of OmniOS. We express our gratitude to the FreeBSD community for their comprehensive and well-maintained documentation, which serves as the foundation for this work.
